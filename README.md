# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
With the enormous growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of applications running on top of it is increasing day by day.
Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is becoming more important. 
Our task to build network intrusion detection system to detect anomalies and attacks in the network. There are two problems:
Binomial Classification: Activity is normal or attack
Multinomial classification: Activity is normal or DOS or PROBE or R2L or U2R 
The attack classes are:
1) DOS: denial-of-service
2) R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password
3) U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various “buffer overflow” attacks
4) Probing: surveillance and another probing, e.g., port scanning

The dataset used was NSL-KDD dataset and Machine Learning Models used were NAÏVE BAYES, DESCISION TREE, LOGISTIC REGRESSION and SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)
